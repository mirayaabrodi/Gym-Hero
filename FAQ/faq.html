            <h3>How can i join your group workouts?</h3>
            <p>To become a part of any group at GYM on a regular basis, you are to <br> have at least the Starter
              membership
              card. However, if you would like to <br> give a crack at group training, you can visit a free workout. It
              takes
              place <br> every Saturday at our gym and includes elements of several disciplines.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3>What trainning is the better for me?</h3>
            <p>It is a difficult question to answer. If you have no previous experience in <br> training or are trying
              it
              for
              the first time. To achieve the best possible <br> result during your further training, we recommend our
              new
              members to <br> take part in the free physical test. Afterward, we will pick the most <br> suitable
              training
              course for you.</p>

            <p>Usually, we accept members aged at 18 and higher, but there are some <br> exceptions for teenagers and
              children
              under 13 years old. For these <br> membership categories, we have special group training, aimed at the
              <br>
              development of basic physical skills including endurance and muscular <br> power.</p>

            <p>Sure you can. We always encourage our members to involve their <br> friends in training and sports
              activities. According to the rules & <br> regulations of our gym, your friend or family member can take
              part
              in <br> one workout. If your friend decides to join us, you can get an annual <br> membership discount.
